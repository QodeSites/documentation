# Software Documentation

Welcome to the software documentation! This guide outlines the framework, technologies, integration, and development standards we are using to build and deploy our software. Below is an overview of the key sections:

## Framework Overview

1. **[Product](product.md)**  
   Purpose, usage, scalability, key features, and target audience.

2. **[Technology](technology.md)**  
   Discussion on the technologies and frameworks used (e.g., React, Next.js) and the reasons behind these choices, such as performance, scalability, and ease of understanding. Styling will be done using Tailwind CSS.

3. **[Integration](integration.md)**  
   Details on where the frameworks (e.g., React) are executed, what server is used, and the reasoning behind these choices.

4. **[Folder Structure](folder-structure.md)**  
   An explanation of the structured, understandable, and scalable folder setup used in the project.

5. **[API and Backend Communication](api-backend-communication.md)**  
   Overview of the API architecture (REST), endpoint documentation, authentication and authorization methods, error handling, and security measures for API key storage.

6. **[Unified Styling Standard](styling-standard.md)**  
   Guidelines to maintain consistent styles across all pages and components, including how styling should be applied.

7. **[Deployment Process](deployment-process.md)**  
   Details on the build script, deployment to VPS, and Nginx configuration setup.

8. **[Documentation](documentation.md)**  
   A guide to documenting each hook, working strategy, and function used in the project.

9. **[Open Source Tools](open-source-tools.md)**  
   Usage of open-source tools whenever required and as applicable.

10. **[Third-party Integrations](third-party-integrations.md)**  
    A list of external services and libraries, including their purposes and configuration details.

11. **[Branching Strategy](branching-strategy.md)**  
    Details on the branching strategy where code is first pushed to a development branch before merging into the main/production branch to keep the production environment stable until final approval.

12. **[Development Guidelines](development-guidelines.md)**  
    Coding standards, best practices for component development, and documentation requirements for new features.
