# Unified Styling Standard

## Styling Approach

- **Consistent Styles**: Maintain similar styles across all pages and components to ensure a unified look and feel.
- **Utility Classes**: Use Tailwind CSS for utility classes that promote consistency and reduce custom CSS.

## Best Practices

- **Component-Specific Styles**: Styles should be scoped to components to avoid global CSS pollution.
- **Theme Consistency**: Adhere to a predefined color palette, typography, and spacing guidelines throughout the application.
