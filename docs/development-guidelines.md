# Development Guidelines

## Coding Standards

- Follow JavaScript ES6+ standards.
- Use consistent naming conventions (camelCase for variables, PascalCase for components).

## Best Practices for Component Development

- Keep components small and focused on a single responsibility.
- Reuse components wherever possible to avoid duplication.

## Documentation Requirements

- All new features should include accompanying documentation.
- Document the purpose, usage, and any important details for each new component or feature.

## Additional Guidelines

- Write unit tests for critical components and functions.
- Use version control effectively, including meaningful commit messages.
