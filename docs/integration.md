# Integration

## Execution Environment

- **Frontend Execution**: React is executed on the client-side, with Next.js handling server-side rendering for optimized performance.
- **Backend Integration**: Our backend is powered by Node.js, providing a seamless integration with the frontend via RESTful APIs.

## Server Configuration

- **Server**: Nginx serves as our web server, chosen for its high performance and ability to handle concurrent connections efficiently.
- **Deployment**: Applications are deployed on a VPS (Virtual Private Server) for full control over the environment and better scalability options.
